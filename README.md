# PongPlusPlus
Pong++ is a rendetion of Pong created using C++ and SFML.

It is currently mostly complete.

To compile this project for your system, make sure that the SFML include (ex. SFML/Graphics.hpp) and library files (ex. libsfml-graphics.lib for Windows or libsfml-graphics.so on Linux) are either in a system folder or added to your project's include/linker path.

A pre-made build for Windows will come soon.
